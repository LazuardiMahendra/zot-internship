'''
A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# Note: this can be made faster and clearer by counting top down (999 to 100 instead of 100 to 999)
# For number of digits above 4 (e.g. between 10000 and 99999), it is better to check top down.
# But it's nice to be able to see the process and other palindromic numbers too
# To make it even faster, can start trialing from 900 instead of 100
